# Heritage connector architecture — stage status

Canonical freeze record for the heritage connector work. This is the file to
read before touching `src/heritage/` or proposing new heritage connector
work. It supersedes the WIP framing in `docs/HERITAGE_RECONCILIATION_2026-08-24.md`
and `docs/HERITAGE_RESEARCH_HANDOFF_2026-08-23.md`, which remain as
historical working notes but do not describe the current, frozen state.

## Stage 1 — heritage connector data spine

**APPROVED / FROZEN.**

The typed connector graph (`HERITAGE_REGISTRY`, `HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_REGISTRY`,
`HERITAGE_DISAGREEMENT_REGISTRY`, `HERITAGE_NEGATIVE_RELATIONSHIP_REGISTRY`,
`HERITAGE_COMPOSITION_POLICIES`, `HERITAGE_CONCEPT_REGISTRY`) and its schema
and validator (`src/heritage/schema.js`, `src/heritage/validator.js`,
`src/heritage/schema-helpers.js`) replaced the legacy
`attestedCombinations`/`validateHeritageCombination` model. Went through
multiple correction rounds, most recently reconciled against a
source-verification addendum (`docs/HERITAGE_RECONCILIATION_2026-08-24.md`).

## Stage 2 — deterministic heritage connector resolver

**APPROVED / FROZEN.**

`src/heritage/resolver.js` (`resolveHeritageConnections` and its exported
helpers) is a pure function mapping an interpreted reading state, the Stage 1
registries, and explicitly injected runtime evidence to eligible connector
presentations. It produces no prose — structured, traceable selections only.
Went through six correction rounds, each closing a specific semantic defect
identified in review; none weakened a test or a compliance gate to get green.

### Frozen Stage-2 code baseline

```
df8cf22b9257c2a7fb75affd30b5e7dc6d15caa0
```

This is the CODE baseline. Documentation commits (including this file) may
move the branch head beyond this SHA — that does not change what "frozen"
refers to. If a later commit changes `src/heritage/resolver.js` behaviour,
that commit is reopening Stage 2, not extending the freeze.

### Verification at freeze (branch `feature/heritage-connectors`, commit `df8cf22`)

- `tests/heritage/resolver.test.js`: **123/123**
- `node --test tests/heritage/validator.test.js tests/heritage/falsification.test.js tests/heritage/integration.test.js tests/heritage/resolver.test.js`: **219/219**
- `node --test tests/qise/reading-variation.test.js tests/ui-language.test.js`: **16/16**
- `npm test`: **1026/1026** across 71 discovered test files
- `npm run build`: clean
- `npm run lint:bundle`: clean (copy blocklist, attractiveness, egress allowlist, biometric egress all `ok`)
- `git diff --check`: clean
- `npm run audit:release`: `Release gate: BLOCKED` — blocked only by pre-existing
  release/evidence/store-approval gaps (rights clearance, source
  verification, store submissions), none introduced by Stage 1 or Stage 2

### Open source-review flag, carried forward rather than special-cased

`five-mountains-mutual-facing-fullness` carries `evidenceStrength:
"RECORDED_NOT_VERIFIED"` and is therefore correctly ceilinged at
`SOURCE_PANEL_CEILING`, not `ACTIVE`, even though its cited source is itself
`verified`. This is the resolver working as designed (a source being solidly
identified is not the same fact as this connector's specific predicate having
been checked against it) — it is flagged here as a source-evidence item for
separate research, not a resolver defect, and must not be special-cased in
the resolver to bypass it.

### Architectural locks

These are the contracts a regression test would need to demonstrably break
before Stage 2 is reopened. They are not aspirations — each is enforced by a
named test in `tests/heritage/resolver.test.js` or the surrounding heritage
suite.

- The historical graph and runtime/editorial composition are separate
  concerns; the resolver never composes prose (that is Stage 3).
- Static measurement/capture capability (`measurementAvailability`) is never
  used to decide whether a historical claim is true.
- Condition AST truth (`evaluateConditionExpression`) comes only from the
  explicitly injected `conditionContext` — never inferred, never guessed.
- `runtimeBindingContext` is a finite, registry-derived, fail-closed
  contract: recognised binding pairs are derived from the ACTIVE
  `FORBID_RUNTIME_BINDING` records in the injected
  `negativeRelationshipRegistry` (via `canonicalRef`), the context and every
  entry must be a genuine plain closed object (`isPlainRecord` +
  `Reflect.ownKeys`-based `hasExactOwnKeys`, not `Object.keys` alone, so a
  class instance, `Date`/`Map`, or a hidden symbol/non-enumerable property
  cannot pass), and a malformed context aborts the ENTIRE resolution
  (`abstentionReasonCode: "INVALID_RUNTIME_BINDING_CONTEXT"`) rather than
  failing closed only for the connectors it happens to implicate.
- Shen remains heritage-only/unmeasurable; the only door from that into a
  runtime claim is the `shen-unmeasurable` `FORBID_RUNTIME_BINDING` rule.
- Modern Qi Se measurement cannot classify Five Forms/Five Elements
  (`no-qise-to-form-classification`); historical co-presence of the two in a
  source-backed connector is not, by itself, an attempted binding.
- Concept-only connectors (no `CONSTRUCT` participant) do not inherit an
  unrelated construct's selected lineage strength or restriction.
- Disagreements remain first-class (`CONSTRUCT`/`CONNECTOR`/`LINEAGE`
  targets), never silently harmonised.
- `prohibitedForUserInference` stays `true` on every surfaced connector
  entry, unconditionally.
- No `Math.random()` / `Date.now()` anywhere in content selection —
  everything is deterministic given its inputs (`occurrence`, registry
  content).
- No arbitrary/recursive graph traversal — concept-only connector candidacy
  is a single, explicit, caller-supplied anchor, not a walk.
- No Stage 3 integration has begun. `reflection.js`, `reading-tiers.js`,
  scanner geometry, historical source dispositions, and connector
  relationships were not touched by Stage 2.

**Do not reopen Stage 2 without a demonstrated regression against one of
these frozen contracts.**

## Stage 3 — not started

Prose composition and integration into `src/qise/reflection.js` /
`src/qise/reading-tiers.js` is out of scope for everything above and has not
begun. Any future Stage 3 work should branch from `main` after this freeze
record lands, not from `feature/heritage-connectors`.
